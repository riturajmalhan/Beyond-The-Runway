            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Since 1982, Beyond the Runway(BTR) has earned a reputation for discovering and developing models for local and international markets.
            It was founded by Ritu Raj Malhan and Moon Choi based in Vancouver. Hawley at a time when there was a need in the Vancouver market for an agency with an international outlook, that also had the model’s best interests at heart.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their own experience as international models and the relationships they have built over the years with top clients and agents around the world have helped them build one of the premier modelling agencies in Canada. Known for his honesty and straight-forward style, Richard has earned a trustworthy name in the business. To this day these are the values on which we pride ourselves.
            This legacy is continued by Rya Berkelaar, a former BTR’s model with over 20+ years of experience in the industry as a model, booker and manager, having helped develop careers of some of Canada’s most successful models.
            </p>
            <p>
            Under our team’s expertise and hands-on approach, BTR’s International Model Management continues to offer personalized management that is informed to the realities of the business, while being sensitive to the needs and concerns of each individual model as their careers develop.
            We believe that by providing the proper tools and creating a healthy and informed environment, we help our models to succeed and grow both professionally and personally.
